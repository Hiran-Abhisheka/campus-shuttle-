# Campus Shuttle — Frontend (UI)

This repository contains a simple React + TypeScript frontend scaffold for the Campus Shuttle project. It implements a basic layout, routing and two starter pages (Home and Login). The app uses mock data and placeholders for integration points (Google Maps, Firebase) which will be wired later.

Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Assumptions made

- Frontend-only for now (no backend wiring).  
- Using Vite + React + TypeScript and plain CSS (keeps setup minimal).  

Next steps I can take for you

- Integrate Google Maps in the Home page.  
- Add authentication UI flow and connect to Firebase.  
- Add tests (React Testing Library).  
- Add Tailwind or Material UI if you prefer a different styling approach.
